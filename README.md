## Software Engineering Metrics

Before we can measure the software engineering productivity of a developer, we must first decide what to measure.
It is extremely important to consider what metrics you are going to use to examine the productivity of a developer,
as many issues can arise with your analyses. In this section, I am going to outline a couple of commonly used metrics
and discuss their individual advantages and disadvantages.

A decent criteria for judging the effectiveness of a metric is if is easily measurable, actionable and reflects value
added to the business. By measurable, I mean the metric can be extracted from the activity of the developer without
interfering with their workflow or impeding their productivity. If a metric is actionable then the value of that metric
can be actively improved by the developer. Finally, a metric should be related to value added to the company, be this
an increase in revenue or improvement to a company's commercial product.

Finally, we must also consider an important factor which always come up when discussing software engineering measurement:

> You Get What You Measure

This simple line might seem fairly innocuous but actually presents a major problem when trying to measure software engineering productivity.
In fact, this issue arises when you attempt to measure productivity anywhere. When you begin to measure aspects of a developers workflow
to determine their productivity, the developer may then go out of their way to artificially inflate this specific aspect in order to raise
their preserved productivity. This practise is called gamification of metrics and can pose a difficult challenge to productivity analysts.

### Lines of Code

Probably the most trivial metrics that can be measured involves lines of code, or LOC.
We can count either the total number of LOC belonging to a developer currently in the project or count the LOC that have been
changed by the developer.
